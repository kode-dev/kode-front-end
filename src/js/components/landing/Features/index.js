              Code reviews are a common practice in great software engineering teams. By using an assessment that is in line with actual engineering work, you have a much better glimpse of how someone would actually work on the job, on your team. 
              Solving a programming puzzle well doesn't give much of a signal on how well a candidate can understand code, communicate that understanding to make the solution better.
